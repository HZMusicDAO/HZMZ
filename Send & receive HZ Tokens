Next, lets create a smart contract to be able to send and receive HZ tokens between users.
Sure, we can create a smart contract that allows users to send and receive HZ tokens between each other. Here's an example of what the code for such a contract might look like:

typescript
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@solana/spl-token/program-solana/Token.sol";

contract HZTransfer {
    Token public hzToken;

    constructor(address _hzTokenAddress) {
        hzToken = Token(_hzTokenAddress);
    }

    function transferHZ(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(hzToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _amount), "Transfer failed");
    }

    function approveHZ(address _spender, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(hzToken.approve(_spender, _amount), "Approval failed");
    }

    function getHZBalance(address _address) public view returns (uint256) {
        return hzToken.balanceOf(_address);
    }
}
This contract uses the Solana SPL Token program to interact with the HZ token. The constructor function takes in the address of an existing HZ token contract, and creates a reference to that contract within the transfer contract.

The transferHZ function allows a user to send HZ tokens to another user, by transferring tokens from the caller's address to the specified _to address. The function checks that the transfer was successful, and reverts the transaction if it fails.

The approveHZ function allows a user to approve another address (e.g. a smart contract) to spend HZ tokens on their behalf. This is necessary for certain functions that require the user's tokens to be transferred on their behalf.

Finally, the getHZBalance function allows a user to view their current balance of HZ tokens at a given address.

Note that this contract is just an example, and may need to be modified depending on the specific requirements of the project.
