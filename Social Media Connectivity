To enable sharing of content from the HZ platform to popular social media sites, you can use social media APIs and libraries to programmatically post content on behalf of users. Here is a high-level overview of how you can implement this feature:

Integrate social media APIs and libraries: Research the API and library documentation for each social media site you want to enable sharing for. Each platform will have a unique API and set of requirements for authentication and content formatting. You can use libraries like python-social-auth or django-allauth to help with authentication and data management.

Create a share button: On your platform, create a share button or link that allows users to share content to social media sites. When clicked, this button will trigger the social media API to post content on behalf of the user.

Authenticate users: Before a user can share content, they must authenticate with the social media site. You can use OAuth or other authentication protocols to securely authenticate users.

Format content: Each social media platform has specific requirements for formatting content. For example, Twitter has a maximum character limit and Instagram requires images to be a specific size. Make sure to format the content correctly before sharing it to social media.

Post content: Once the content is formatted and the user is authenticated, use the social media API to programmatically post the content to the selected social media site.

Handle errors: Make sure to handle errors that may arise when posting content to social media. For example, the social media site may be down or the user's authentication token may have expired.

By implementing these steps, you can enable users to share content from your platform to popular social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Pinterest, Fanbase, and Onlyfans.
